# Portfolio
This is a portfolio for myself, Jaron Kenyon. The header contains my name and a nav that links to the three sections of the page, About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. The About Me section has a brief paragraph about myself. The My Work section has my work displayed in 5 boxes that have links to the corresponding project (Run Buddy is the only actual link for the time being, the rest are placeholders). The Contact Me has my phone number, email, and link to my GitHub page.

## Features 
* The links in the nav bar bring you to different sections of the page.
